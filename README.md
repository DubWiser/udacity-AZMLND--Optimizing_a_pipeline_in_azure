# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, I built and optimized an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a custom Scikit-learn Logistic Regression model. I optimised the hyperparameters of this model using HyperDrive. Then, I used Azure AutoML to find an optimal model using the same dataset, so that I can compare the results of the two methods.

The following image illustrates the main steps I followed during the project.

The whole exercise can be broken down into the following steps: 

Step 1: Set up the train script, create a Tabular Dataset from this set & evaluate it with the custom-code Scikit-learn logistic regression model.

Step 2: Creation of a Jupyter Notebook and use of HyperDrive to find the best hyperparameters for the logistic regression model.

Step 3: Next, load the same dataset in the Notebook with TabularDatasetFactory and use AutoML to find another optimized model.

Step 4: Finally, compare the results of the two methods and write a research report i.e. this Readme file.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
This dataset contains data about individuals applying for bank loans. The objective is to develop a model based on the information provided about each individual, to predict whether they will subscribe to a service or not.
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
The best performing model was found to be a voting ensemble with 91.5% accuracy.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
Parameter sampler

I specified the parameter sampler as mentioned below:

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
